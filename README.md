# **Top 10 Expected Company Questions**

If you want the highest hit rate, these get repeated like crazy:

1. Two Sum
2. Reverse linked list
3. Valid parentheses
4. Rotate array
5. Group anagrams
6. Kadane’s algorithm
7. Merge sorted arrays
8. Subarray sum equals K
9. Longest substring without repeating characters
10. Detect cycle in linked list

If you master these 10 — you’ll breeze through tests.

## ✔ **1. Arrays (companies LOVE these)**

* Reverse an array
* Rotate array left/right
* Move zeroes to end
* Find missing number
* Find duplicate number
* Find second largest
* Merge two sorted arrays
* Count frequency of elements
* Kadane’s algorithm (max subarray sum)
* Two Sum

---

## ✔ **2. Strings (90% logic tests come from here)**

* Reverse string
* Palindrome check
* Longest common prefix
* Count vowels/consonants
* Remove duplicates
* First non-repeating character
* Frequency of characters
* Anagram check
* Longest substring without repeating characters
* Print all permutations (just recursive understanding)

---

## ✔ **3. HashMap / Hashing (interviewers LOVE this)**

* Two Sum using HashMap
* Subarray sum == k
* Find majority element
* Longest subarray with zero sum
* Check if array contains duplicates
* Group anagrams
* Count pairs with given sum
* Frequency-based sorting

---

## ✔ **4. Basic Math / Logic (companies ask these often)**

* Prime check
* GCD / HCF
* Count digits, sum of digits
* Armstrong number
* Fibonacci (iterative)
* Factorial

---

## ✔ **5. Sorting / Searching Lite**

* Binary search (implement yourself)
* Bubble sort (concept)
* Selection sort (concept)
* Insertion sort (concept)
* Merge sorted arrays

(Don’t waste time on complex sorting internals — service companies don’t ask it)

---

## ✔ **6. Stack / Queue (small but important)**

* Valid parentheses
* Min stack logic
* Next greater element
* Implement queue using stack
* Implement stack using queue

---

## ✔ **7. Linked List (minimum viable — don’t go too deep)**

* Reverse linked list
* Middle of linked list
* Detect cycle (Floyd algo)
* Merge two sorted lists
* Remove nth node from end

(Anything more than this is overkill for service jobs)

---

## ✔ **8. Small DP-like thinking (only ONE)**

* Climbing Stairs problem (basic DP thinking)
